# Performance Optimization Configuration

This file contains the optimizations applied to the Node.js application for better performance.

## Database Optimizations

1. **Connection Pooling**: Enhanced Prisma configuration with optimized connection pool settings
2. **Query Optimization**: Added query optimization utilities for batch operations and common patterns
3. **Transaction Management**: Improved transaction handling with proper timeout and isolation level settings

## Caching Strategy

1. **Enhanced In-Memory Cache**: LRU eviction, memory monitoring, and automatic cleanup
2. **Cache Statistics**: Detailed metrics and monitoring for cache performance
3. **Intelligent TTL**: Different cache durations for different data types
4. **Batch Operations**: Support for multi-get and multi-set operations

## Request Processing

1. **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent rate limiting with different limits for different endpoints
2. **Body Parser Optimization**: Conditional parsing and size limits
3. **Compression**: Optimized gzip compression with smart filtering
4. **Response Optimization**: Automatic pagination and consistent API responses

## Monitoring & Health Checks

1. **Performance Metrics**: Real-time monitoring of response times, memory usage, and database performance
2. **Health Endpoints**: Comprehensive health checks for all system components
3. **Request Logging**: Enhanced logging with performance metrics
4. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with proper logging

## Security Enhancements

1. **Enhanced CORS**: Optimized CORS configuration with proper headers
2. **Security Headers**: Added security headers for XSS protection
3. **Session Security**: Improved session configuration with security best practices

## Environment-Specific Settings

### Development

- Detailed logging and debugging
- Lower compression levels
- Higher request size limits
- More permissive rate limiting

### Production

- Minimal logging
- Higher compression levels
- Stricter size limits
- Tighter rate limiting
- Enhanced security headers

## Usage

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment variables
2. Run `npm run dev` for development
3. Run `npm run start:prod` for production
4. Monitor health with `npm run health`
5. Check metrics with `npm run metrics`

## Performance Benefits

- **Reduced Response Times**: Intelligent caching and compression
- **Better Resource Management**: Connection pooling and memory monitoring
- **Improved Scalability**: Rate limiting and request optimization
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Health checks and error handling
- **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
